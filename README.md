# spanner-sql-udf

This repository contains a set of Spanner User-Defined Functions (UDFs) for a
number of MySQL built-in functions. Combined together with Spanner's existing
built-in functions, they provide coverage for most of MySQL's built-in
functions. These UDFs are designed to assist customers migrating applications
from MySQL to Spanner by providing definitions for MySQL built-in functions not
already supported in Spanner, reducing the effort to migrate application code
and queries.

Spannerâ€™s support for UDFs will be available soon.
